This is a program that will translate your texts into the psuedo languages like "pig latin" in English or "kuş dili" in Turkish. You can select which language you want from the bookmarks on the left. You can also choose which variation of these languages you want to translate from the tape stickers on top of the right page.

It's a very simple and fun webpage :)
